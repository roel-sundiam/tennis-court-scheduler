# Tennis Court Scheduler - Development Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Today (July 12, 2025)

### Admin Panel Coin Balance Fix
- [x] **Fixed VGTennisMorningClub Balance Display Issue**
  - Admin panel was showing "Club balance not available" instead of the actual 536 coins
  - Root cause: RoelSundiam's unlimited access was preventing club balance from displaying
  - Created dedicated `/club-balance` API endpoint for admin-specific balance viewing
  - Added `getClubBalance()` method to coin service for direct club balance fetching

- [x] **Technical Implementation**
  - **Frontend**: Modified `admin-panel.component.ts` to use `getClubBalance()` instead of `loadBalance()`
  - **Service**: Added `getClubBalance()` method in `coin.service.ts` with dedicated API call to `/club-balance`
  - **Backend**: Added `/club-balance` route in `server/routes/coins.js` with admin authentication
  - **Database**: Endpoint properly fetches VGTennisMorningClub balance (536 coins) from MongoDB

- [x] **Admin Panel Features Confirmed Working**
  - ‚úÖ Current club balance: 536 coins displayed correctly
  - ‚úÖ Total purchased coins shown for the club
  - ‚úÖ Total used coins by club members displayed
  - ‚úÖ Last updated timestamp working
  - ‚úÖ Refresh balance button functional
  - ‚úÖ Add coins to club functionality working
  - ‚úÖ Real-time balance updates after adding coins

### Current Status
- Admin panel coin balance display fully functional ‚úÖ
- VGTennisMorningClub balance (536 coins) properly shown ‚úÖ
- RoelSundiam can view and manage club balance while maintaining unlimited personal access ‚úÖ
- All coin system features tested and working ‚úÖ

## üîß Technical Details from Today's Session

### Files Modified Today
- **Frontend**:
  - `tennis-court-scheduler/src/app/pages/admin-panel/admin-panel.component.ts` - Fixed balance loading logic
  - `tennis-court-scheduler/src/app/services/coin.service.ts` - Added getClubBalance() method

- **Backend**:
  - `server/routes/coins.js` - Added /club-balance endpoint with authentication

### Problem Solved
**Issue**: Admin panel displayed "Club balance not available" instead of showing 536 coins
**Root Cause**: Admin panel was filtering out balance data when `isUnlimited: true` (RoelSundiam's status)
**Solution**: Created separate API endpoint specifically for club balance viewing that bypasses unlimited user filtering

### API Changes
- **New Endpoint**: `GET /api/coins/club-balance` (admin-only)
- **Returns**: VGTennisMorningClub balance with current: 536, totalPurchased, totalUsed, lastUpdated
- **Authentication**: Requires RoelSundiam authorization header
